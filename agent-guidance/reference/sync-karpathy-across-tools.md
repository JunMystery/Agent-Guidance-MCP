# Cross-Tool Sync Guide: Karpathy Principles

**Keeping AI configurations synchronized across Cursor, Claude, VS Code/Copilot, and other tools**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** May 13, 2026

---

## Problem & Solution

Your team uses multiple AI tools:
- **Cursor** (IDE-integrated development)
- **Claude** (API and web interface)
- **VS Code / GitHub Copilot** (autocomplete and inline suggestions)

**Challenge:** Principles can drift across tools if not kept in sync

**Solution:** This guide establishes a single source of truth and sync process

3. Terminology should be consistent across files
4. Examples should align

---

## 🔄 Sync Process

### Quarterly Sync (Recommended Cadence)

**When:** Every 3 months (end of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Process:**

1. **Read Master Document** (5 min)
   - Open `principles/karpathy-framework.md`
   - Skim all 4 principles
   - Note any recent clarifications or changes

2. **Check Copilot Config** (5 min)
   - Open `.instructions.md`
   - Compare sections to master doc
   - Look for drift (outdated examples, missing context)
   - [ ] Principles accurate?
   - [ ] Examples current?
   - [ ] Links working?

3. **Check Cursor Rules** (5 min)
   - Open `.agent-guidance/.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc`
   - Compare to master doc
   - [ ] Principles match?
   - [ ] Cursor-specific guidance useful?
   - [ ] Scenarios realistic?

4. **Check Claude Instructions** (5 min)
   - Open `prompts/claude-system-instructions.md`
   - Compare system prompt to master doc
   - [ ] Principles accurately translated?
   - [ ] Examples appropriate for Claude?
   - [ ] Self-Check template current?

5. **Check Supporting Docs** (5 min)
   - Spot-check: quick-reference.md, code-review-checklist.md, self-check-report-template.md
   - [ ] Each references principles correctly?
   - [ ] Links to framework doc working?
   - [ ] Terminology consistent?

6. **Make Updates** (if needed)
   - Update any drifting configs
   - Commit changes with message: "Q1 2026 sync: Karpathy principles configs"

7. **Validate** (if changes made)
   - Test Copilot with a sample prompt
   - Test Cursor with a sample file edit
   - Test Claude with system prompt
   - Verify each applies principles

---

### Ad-Hoc Sync (When Needed)

**Trigger:** Team member notices tool isn't applying principles correctly

**Process:**

1. Document what went wrong: "Claude accepted over-engineered code without questioning simplicity"
2. Read relevant principle in `principles/karpathy-framework.md`
3. Check if tool config mentions it: Search for keyword in `.instructions.md` / `.cursor/...` / `claude-system-instructions.md`
4. If not mentioned: Add it
5. If mentioned but unclear: Clarify it
6. Test fix
7. Log in issue tracker: "[Tool] [Principle] - Updated config to prevent [issue]"

## 🚨 Common Drift Scenarios & Fixes

### Scenario 1: Master Doc Changes, Tool Configs Lag

**Symptom:** "Principle #2 now includes 'don't over-abstract', but Copilot config still says abstractions OK"

**Fix:**
1. Update `.instructions.md` to mention abstraction rule
2. Update `.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc` similarly
3. Update `claude-system-instructions.md` system prompt
4. Test with sample code to confirm all tools now check for over-abstraction

---

### Scenario 2: Tool Acts Against Principles

**Symptom:** "Claude generated 300-line strategy pattern for simple problem (violates Simplicity)"

**Cause:** System prompt doesn't emphasize simplicity strongly enough

**Fix:**
1. Check `prompts/claude-system-instructions.md`
2. Look for "Simplicity" section
3. Make it more prominent or clear
4. Test with similar problem: does Claude now simplify?

---

### Scenario 3: Tool-Specific Misalignment

**Symptom:** "Cursor applies all 4 principles beautifully, but Copilot seems to skip #3 (Surgical Changes)"

**Cause:** `.instructions.md` might not emphasize surgical changes in Copilot context

**Fix:**
1. Open `.instructions.md`
2. Find Principle #3 section
3. Add specific Copilot context: "When suggesting inline edits, only change the line requested, not surrounding code"
4. Add example specific to Copilot's inline mode
5. Test Copilot with a request to modify one line—verify it only changes that line

---

## Questions & Support

**Q: What if a tool can't express a principle clearly?**  
A: That's OK—focus on what the tool CAN do. E.g., GitHub Copilot's limitations mean it can't always ask clarifying questions, so emphasize that in `instructions.md`.

**Q: How often should I actually sync?**  
A: Minimally quarterly. More frequently if: (a) principles change, (b) team discovers misalignment, (c) new tools added.

**Q: What if I disagree with a principle?**  
A: Raise it with the team. Discuss. If consensus changes, update `principles/karpathy-framework.md` FIRST, then sync all tools.

**Q: Can I have tool-specific variations of principles?**  
A: Minor emphasis variations are OK (e.g., Cursor emphasizes "surgical changes" more because it edits code directly). But the 4 core principles must be consistent.
