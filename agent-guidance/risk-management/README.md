## 🎯 Overview

**Risk Categories:**
1. **Security Risks** (vulnerabilities, data leaks)
2. **Quality Risks** (hallucination, bad code)
3. **Performance Risks** (slow queries, memory leaks)
4. **Cost Risks** (high API usage)
5. **Operational Risks** (AI unavailable, rate limits)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- ✓ Prevent (constraints, training)
- ✓ Detect (Self-Check, code review)
- ✓ Respond (escalation, fallback)
- ✓ Learn (track, improve prompts)

├─ Self-Check PASS?
│  ├─ YES → Code Review
│  │  ├─ Approve? → Merge ✓
│  │  └─ Reject → Iterate (Round 2)
│  │     ├─ PASS? → Merge ✓
│  │     └─ FAIL? → Escalate ✗

│  └─ NO → Self-Fix Round 1
│     ├─ PASS? → Code Review
│     └─ FAIL? → Self-Fix Round 2
│        ├─ PASS? → Code Review
│        └─ FAIL? → ESCALATE ✗
│           (Log in AI Failure Log)
│           (Assign to: Mentor/Tech Lead)
│           (Decision: Manual code or rework prompt)

## 📊 Risk Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Alert Level |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Security violations | 0 | >0 = Critical |
| Hallucination rate | <5% | >10% = High |
| AI iteration count | avg <= 2 | >3 = Problem |
| Code review time | <30 min | >60 min = Warning |
| Defect escape rate | <5% | >10% = Critical |
| Cost per task | Monitor | >$5 = Alert |

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before task starts:
- [ ] Security constraints reviewed?
- [ ] Team trained on escalation path?
- [ ] Failure log setup?
- [ ] Metrics tracking ready?
- [ ] Budget allocated?
