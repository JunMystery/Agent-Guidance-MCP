# Onboarding - AI Agent Coding Standards

**Onboarding program for engineers joining AI-assisted development projects.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Day 1: Orientation

1. **Read documentation (20 minutes):**
   - [`quick-reference.md`](quick-reference.md) ← **START HERE** ⭐⭐⭐
   - [`first-task-walkthrough.md`](first-task-walkthrough.md)

2. **Setup project:**
   ```bash
   git clone [project-repo]
   cd project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Learn .cursorrules:**
   - Open: `project/agent-guidance/.cursorrules`
   - Understand: Framework, naming conventions, security rules

4. **Setup IDE (if using Cursor/Windsurf):**
   - Copy `.cursorrules` to project root
   - Restart IDE

---

### Day 2-3: First Task

1. **Pick a simple task** (API endpoint, unit tests, refactor)
2. **Follow walkthrough:** [`first-task-walkthrough.md`](first-task-walkthrough.md) (30 min)
3. **Apply pipeline:** [`../quality-control/`](../quality-control/)
4. **Get code reviewed** by mentor
