# CHANGELOG - AI Agent Coding Standards

Track versions and updates for the AI Agent Coding Standards framework.

## [3.2.3] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **OpenCode MCP Support:** Added automatic configuration of `opencode.json` in the workspace root during auto-installation.
- **OpenCode Formatting:** Built a dedicated exporter in `install-mcp.py` to target the custom JSON schema used by OpenCode (e.g. `type: "local"`, command arrays, and `"environment"` keys).

## [3.2.2] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **Global & Workspace Rule Auto-Installation:** Updated `scripts/install-mcp.py` to automatically configure global agent guidance rules in `~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md`, workspace rules (`.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`, `.copilotrules`), and supporting agent files (`agents/*.md`).
- **Consolidation Unit Tests:** Added `tests/test_consolidation.py` to verify unified tokenization and savings tracking.

### Changed
- **Codebase Consolidation:** Merged token savings tracking across `server.py`, `pipelines.py`, and `project_context.py` into a shared `utils.py`. Consolidated duplicate `tokenize` functions across `text.py` and `project_scan.py`.
- **Version Bump:** Upgraded version to v3.2.2 across project configuration and repository logs.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Project-context MCP tools** - Added bounded project tree, code search, file read, and snapshot export tools so AI agents can inspect codebases quickly without broad file reads.
- **Focused documentation set** - Split detailed setup, usage, MCP surface, project-context, and development guidance into dedicated docs under `docs/`.

### Changed
- **README landing page** - Reduced the root README to the essential project overview, installation, quick start, documentation links, MCP summary, and development command.
- **Version synchronization** - Updated framework and package release surfaces to v3.1.1.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Cursor Native Auto-Installation:** Updated `scripts/install-mcp.py` to automatically detect and configure the `agent-guidance-mcp` server inside the global Cursor configuration file `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (for Cursor Native MCP).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Codex Auto-Installation:** Updated `scripts/install-mcp.py` to automatically detect and configure the `agent-guidance-mcp` server inside the global Codex config file `~/.codex/config.toml` (for Codex CLI & VS Code/Codex App extension).

## [3.0.1] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **VS Code MCP Client Activation:** Fixed `scripts/run-mcp.cmd` false-positive Explorer-click detection that triggered HTTP transport instead of stdio, and executed `pause`, causing VS Code to hang during extension activation. Stdin is now verified using `timeout` before invoking interactive launcher behavior.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- **Large-file refactor audit scope** - Updated `skills/large-file-refactor/SKILL.md` to use tracked project files as the candidate source and exclude `.venv`, `.vscode`, cache, build, vendor, generated, and binary/media files from broad audits.

### Changed
- **7-step pipeline documentation** - Updated README and onboarding/review docs so the pipeline reflects all 6 Core Principles, 12 security constraints, quality gates, Human Gate checklists, and optional multi-agent collaboration.
- **Review checklist parity** - Added DRY & Reusability and Code Organization checks to reviewer-facing documentation and the PR checklist.
- **Version bump** - Updated framework versioning to v3.0.0 across current project metadata, generated instruction sources, install docs, skill references, index, and multi-agent files.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- **Single source rules generation** - Added `scripts/generate-rules.py`, `rules/agent-manifest.json`, and agent templates so instruction files are generated from shared sources instead of maintained by hand.
- **Rules generation docs** - Added `docs/rules-generation.md` and `docs/repo-map-for-agents.md` for maintainer and agent onboarding.
- **Large-file refactor skill** - Added `skills/large-file-refactor/SKILL.md` and wired it into the skill indexes for responsibility-based file splitting guidance.

### Changed
- **Setup manifest wiring** - `scripts/setup.py` now reads supported agent instruction files from `rules/agent-manifest.json`.
- **Version Bump** - Updated framework versioning to v2.6.0 across current project metadata, generated instruction surfaces, skill references, index, install docs, and multi-agent files.

### Removed
- **Redundant project standards example file** - Removed `PROJECT-STANDARDS-EXAMPLE.md` because `PROJECT-STANDARDS.md` now includes the editable template directly.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **OpenAI Codex / Codex VS Code support** - Added `AGENTS.md` as the Codex instruction surface and a `codex-vscode` on-demand skill capsule.
- **Codex discovery wiring** - Updated setup, install docs, README, and skill indexes so Codex instructions are installed with the rest of the framework.
- **Agent-specific setup menu** - `scripts/setup.py` now lets users install one agent instruction file, choose all, or press `0` to cancel.

### Fixed
- **Cross-drive setup on Windows** - `scripts/setup.py` now falls back to absolute Markdown link prefixes when standards and target projects are on different Windows drives.

### Changed
- **Version Bump** - Updated framework versioning to v2.5.0 across the primary docs, instruction surfaces, skill references, index, install docs, and multi-agent files.
- **Cleaner default installs** - Setup no longer copies every instruction file unless the user chooses all or passes `--agent all`.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **6th Core Principle (Code Organization):** Added code organization and file structure as the 6th Core Principle (`karpathy/principles.md`), including file splitting guidelines (<300 LOC limit), role-based suffixes, barrel exports, and colocation.
- **DRY & Reusability Expansion:** Generalised Principle 5 to apply to all code categories (including configurations, TypeScript types, schemas, and test mocks) instead of just UI and business logic.

### Changed
- **System-wide Principle Count:** Updated principle references from 5 to 6 core principles across all tool config files, multi-agent templates, checklists, and documentation.
- **Version Bump:** Upgraded version to v2.4.0 across the framework.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- **General on-demand skills** - Added accessibility, API design, ADRs, database migrations, error handling, Git workflow, production audit, search-first, skill stocktake, and rules distillation skill capsules adapted from ECC.
- **Agent discovery wiring** - Documented the expanded skill set so supported AI agents can load the new capsules only when relevant.
- **ECC Credit** - Credited ECC as the source for the expanded general skill-set ideas and on-demand structure.

### Changed
- **Version Bump** - Updated repo versioning to v2.3.0 across the primary docs, instruction surfaces, skill references, index, install docs, and multi-agent files.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- **`skills/`** - On-demand skill capsules ported from ECC and wired into the framework docs as task-specific references.
- **ECC Credit** - Explicit attribution added for the imported skill capsules and their on-demand usage model.

### Changed
- **Version Bump** - Updated repo versioning to v2.2.0 across the primary docs and instruction surfaces.
- **`README.md` / `SKILL-REFERENCE.md` / `INDEX.md`** - Updated version strings and skill-loading guidance to reflect on-demand skill capsules.

### Fixed
- **Version parity** - Synchronized the release metadata and verification prompts with the new v2.2.0 release.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added
- **`scripts/setup.py`** - Automated setup script: copies rule files to any project root and auto-rewrites internal links to match the actual folder path. Supports auto-detection of project root and custom path arguments.

### Fixed
- **Link Architecture** - Reverted all internal paths in root instruction files to bare relative paths (`agent-guidance/...`) so they resolve correctly when used directly inside the repo. The `setup.py` script now adds the folder prefix dynamically when copying to external projects.
- **ASCII Bell characters** - Cleaned up `\x07` control characters in Auto-Discovery paths caused by Python escape sequences.
- **Principle 5 parity** - Added DRY & Reusability to `.cursorrules` and `.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc`.
- **Version parity** - Synchronized version to v2.1 across all config, documentation, and multi-agent files.

### Changed
- **`INSTALL.md`** - Rewritten with automated setup as primary installation method.
- **`README.md`** - Quick Start now shows `python Agent-Guidance/scripts/setup.py`.

### Added (Dynamic Skill Auto-Discovery)
- **Auto-Discovery Block** - Injected into all root instruction files (`GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, etc.). Modern AI agents will now self-load relevant standards dynamically based on the task prompt without requiring manual `@reference`.

### Changed
- **Version Bump** - Upgraded framework globally to v2.0.0.
- **`SKILL-REFERENCE.md`** - Updated with Dynamic Auto-Discovery instructions and new Engineering & Compliance references.
